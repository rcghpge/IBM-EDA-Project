# House Sales Project
This is a project I did about house sales in King County, Washington, USA for the IBM Data Science Professional certificate program utilizing EDA, data wrangling, and regression model analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. This was done in Python along with its' libraries: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
